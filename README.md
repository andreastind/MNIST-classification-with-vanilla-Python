# MNIST classification with vanilla Python
In this project we use a very simple neural network (linear classifier) to identify the handwritten digits from the MNIST database.<br>
<br>
The project was created as a part of the exam for the course Introduction to Scientific Programming. <br>
Created in May 2020 by Andreas Tind Damgaard and Magnus Toft Conradsen.
